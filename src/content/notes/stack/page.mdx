# My Stack

I'm currently most productive in the following areas:

## 1. Frameworks (Next.js, Angular, Astro)

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)üóΩ
My primary framework for building performant web applications. I always start with TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability. I leverage React's Server Components and server-side data fetching patterns for optimal performance.

#### Example: Server Components for Data Fetching
```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const items = await response.json();
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

For projects requiring multilingual support, I've implemented internationalization features using libraries like `next-intl`, such as in [youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com).

- [My Old Portfolio Website](https://atichat-old.vercel.app/)
</details>

### [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
Angular is my choice for enterprise-level projects or scenarios where its structure and ecosystem provide significant advantages. It's especially useful for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

#### Hopeisapp

The Hopeisapp project is a social volunteer initiative aimed at providing hope to the youth generation. Developed within two months by youth volunteers, the web app can serve a large number of clients in real-time. Many participants have experienced personal growth and mindfulness through continuous use.

##### My Contributions
- Implemented the frontend world exploration feature with interactive peak system
- Developed character connection backend integration
- Created quiz system with start page and question flow
- Built custom theme system with configurable colors and fonts
- Integrated local storage for user data persistence
- Set up initial project structure using daisyUI for consistent UI components
- Implemented responsive modal designs and form input handling

##### Key Features
- Interactive world exploration
- Character progression system
- Gamified learning modules
- Offline-capable functionality
- Mindfulness tracking

### [Astro](https://astro.build/) üí´
Astro excels in building static sites with high performance. I've utilized it to create fast-loading web pages for projects where simplicity and speed are priorities. I also like content collections, which provide a powerful way to manage and organize structured data in Astro projects.

<details className="mb-1 -mt-2">
<summary className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] mb-2">Content Collections ‚ù§Ô∏è</summary>

Content Collections allow you to define a set of data that is structurally similar, whether it‚Äôs a directory of blog posts, a JSON file of product items, or any data representing multiple items with a consistent format. Collections can store entries in Markdown, MDX, Markdoc, YAML, or JSON files directly within your project.  

For example:  

```
Directory: src/
Directory: newsletter/
  - week-1.md (a collection entry)
  - week-2.md (a collection entry)
  - week-3.md (a collection entry)
Directory: authors/
  - authors.json (a single file containing all collection entries)
```

You can define these collections in Astro using `defineCollection` from `astro:content` and ensure their structure is validated with a schema. Here's an example:

```ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { glob, file } from 'astro/loaders'; // Not available with legacy API

const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: "**/*.md", base: "./src/data/blog" }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  }),
});

const dogs = defineCollection({
  loader: file("src/data/dogs.json"),
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    breed: z.string(),
    temperament: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog, dogs };
```

In this example:
- The `blog` collection gathers Markdown files using a glob loader and enforces a schema with fields like `title` and `pubDate`.
- The `dogs` collection loads data from a JSON file and validates it with fields such as `id`, `breed`, and `temperament`.

This approach makes it simple to manage content-rich static sites with flexibility and speed.

## 2. Styling (Tailwind CSS, motion, shadcn/ui)

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) üå™Ô∏è
My preferred utility-first CSS framework. Its design system allows for rapid prototyping and consistent styling. It integrates well with modern frameworks and helps keep styles organized and maintainable.

#### Benefits of Tailwind
- **Efficiency**: Utility classes colocate styles with markup, reducing context switching.
- **Performance**: Tree-shaking ensures small CSS bundles.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used alongside traditional CSS or other styling approaches.

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) üóø
To streamline UI development, I use shadcn/ui, which offers accessible, customizable primitives for components like buttons, inputs, and themes. It pairs seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

### [motion](https://motion.dev/)
For animations, framer-motion provides a declarative API to create smooth, interactive transitions that enhance user experiences.

## 3. Hosting and Deployment (Vercel, AWS, Plesk)

### Vercel
I use Vercel for its seamless integration with Next.js and its ability to handle deployments efficiently. It's my platform of choice for modern web applications.

### AWS
For hosting static websites, I've used:
- **[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)**: Ensures fast and reliable content delivery.
- **[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**: Offers scalable object storage.
- **[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)**: Provides flexible compute capacity for dynamic applications.

### Plesk and WordPress
I created and managed the website for [dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th) using Plesk hosting and WordPress, gaining experience in traditional web hosting and content management systems.

## 4. Volunteering and Community Impact
- Organized IT events to foster skill development and make a positive societal impact.
- Provided IT support as a volunteer, helping organizations improve their digital infrastructure.

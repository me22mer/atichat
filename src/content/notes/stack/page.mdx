# My Stack

I'm currently most productive in the following areas:

## 1. Frameworks (Next.js, Angular, Astro)

### Next.js (Primary)
Next.js is my primary framework for building performant web applications. I always start with TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability. I leverage React's Server Components and server-side data fetching patterns for optimal performance.

#### Example: Server Components for Data Fetching
```jsx
export default async function Page() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const items = await response.json();
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

For projects requiring multilingual support, I've implemented internationalization features using libraries like `next-intl`, such as in [youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com).

### Angular (Supplementary)
Angular is my choice for enterprise-level projects or scenarios where its structure and ecosystem provide significant advantages. It's especially useful for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

#### Hopeisapp

The Hopeisapp project is a social volunteer initiative aimed at providing hope to the youth generation. Developed within two months by youth volunteers, the web app can serve a large number of clients in real-time. Many participants have experienced personal growth and mindfulness through continuous use.

##### My Contributions
- Implemented the frontend world exploration feature with interactive peak system
- Developed character connection backend integration
- Created quiz system with start page and question flow
- Built custom theme system with configurable colors and fonts
- Integrated local storage for user data persistence
- Set up initial project structure using daisyUI for consistent UI components
- Implemented responsive modal designs and form input handling

##### Key Features
- Interactive world exploration
- Character progression system
- Gamified learning modules
- Offline-capable functionality
- Mindfulness tracking

### Astro (Static Sites)
Astro excels in building static sites with high performance. I've utilized it to create fast-loading web pages for projects where simplicity and speed are priorities.

## 2. Styling (Tailwind CSS, framer-motion, shadcn/ui)

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is my preferred utility-first CSS framework. Its design system allows for rapid prototyping and consistent styling. It integrates well with modern frameworks and helps keep styles organized and maintainable.

#### Benefits of Tailwind
- **Efficiency**: Utility classes colocate styles with markup, reducing context switching.
- **Performance**: Tree-shaking ensures small CSS bundles.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used alongside traditional CSS or other styling approaches.

### shadcn/ui
To streamline UI development, I use shadcn/ui, which offers accessible, customizable primitives for components like buttons, inputs, and themes. It pairs seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

### framer-motion
For animations, framer-motion provides a declarative API to create smooth, interactive transitions that enhance user experiences.

## 3. Hosting and Deployment (Vercel, AWS, Plesk)

### Vercel
I use Vercel for its seamless integration with Next.js and its ability to handle deployments efficiently. It's my platform of choice for modern web applications.

### AWS
For hosting static websites, I've used:
- **CloudFront**: Ensures fast and reliable content delivery.
- **S3**: Offers scalable object storage.
- **EC2**: Provides flexible compute capacity for dynamic applications.

### Plesk and WordPress
I created and managed the website for [dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th) using Plesk hosting and WordPress, gaining experience in traditional web hosting and content management systems.

## 4. Volunteering and Community Impact
- Organized IT events to foster skill development and make a positive societal impact.
- Provided IT support as a volunteer, helping organizations improve their digital infrastructure.

# My Tech Toolbox

üëãHey there! Want to know what gets me fired up in the world of web development? Here's a rundown of my go-to tools and frameworks:

## 1. Frameworks (The Holy Trinity: Next.js, Angular, and Astro)

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): My Digital Swiss Army Knife üóΩ
When it comes to building web apps that pack a punch, Next.js is my ride-or-die. I'm all about that TypeScript life for keeping things neat and tidy. And don't even get me started on those sweet, sweet Server Components and server-side data fetching ‚Äì it's like giving your app superpowers!

#### Example: Server Components for Data Fetching
```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const items = await response.json();
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Oh, and if you're into globetrotting (at least digitally), check out how I've made sites speak multiple languages using `next-intl`. Want to see it in action? Head over to [youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com) and prepare to be amazed!

- [Rockstar Games Clone](https://rockstar-clone-one.vercel.app/) (Because who doesn't want their own virtual crime empire?)
- [Tesla Clone](https://tesla-clone-black-sigma.vercel.app/) (Electric dreams, anyone?)
- [My Old Portfolio Website](https://atichat-old.vercel.app/) (A blast from the past!)

### [Angular](https://angular.dev/): The Enterprise Whisperer
When the big guns come calling, Angular's got my back. It's like the responsible adult in the room, perfect for those massive, scalable projects that make your brain hurt (in a good way).

#### Hopeisapp: Spreading Good Vibes

Picture this: a bunch of young, starry-eyed volunteers creating a social app that's all about hope. That's Hopeisapp for you! We whipped this baby up in just two months, and it's been changing lives ever since.

##### What I Brought to the Table
- Cooked up a frontend world explorer that'll blow your mind
- Got characters connecting like they're at a digital cocktail party
- Quizzes that are actually fun (I know, right?)
- A theme system that's more customizable than your coffee order
- Local storage magic so you never lose your progress
- Set the whole thing up with daisyUI (because who doesn't love a good UI?)
- Made those modals pop and those forms flow

##### The Cool Stuff
- A world to explore that's more addictive than your favorite mobile game
- Level up your character (and yourself)
- Learning that feels like playing
- Works offline (because the internet is sometimes as reliable as a chocolate teapot)
- Keeps tabs on your zen moments

### [Astro](https://astro.build/) üí´
When I need a website that loads faster than you can say "static site generator," Astro's my go-to. And let me tell you about content collections ‚Äì they're like having a personal assistant for all your data needs.

<details className="mb-1 -mt-2">
<summary className="text-gray-600 text-[15px] mb-2">Content Collections: My Secret Weapon ‚ù§Ô∏è</summary>

Imagine having a magic box where you can toss in all sorts of content ‚Äì blog posts, product listings, your grandma's secret recipes ‚Äì and Astro just... gets it. That's content collections for you!

You can mix and match file types like a DJ at a wedding:
- Markdown? Check.
- MDX? You bet.
- JSON? Absolutely.

And the best part? You can tell Astro exactly what to expect in each collection. It's like having a bouncer for your data ‚Äì no unexpected guests allowed!

This setup makes building content-rich sites a breeze. It's so easy, it almost feels like cheating. Almost.

## 2. Styling (Because Looking Good Matters)

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): The Fashion Designer üå™Ô∏è
Tailwind CSS is like having a personal stylist for your website. It's got a utility-first approach that lets me whip up stunning designs faster than you can say "responsive layout."

#### Why Tailwind Rocks My Socks
- It's like coding and designing had a baby ‚Äì styles right where you need 'em.
- Your CSS bundle will be so small, it could fit in a tweet.
- Plays nice with others ‚Äì use it alongside your old-school CSS if you're feeling nostalgic.

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): The Cool Kid on the Block üóø
Think of shadcn/ui as the popular kid who's actually nice to everyone. It's got all these rad, accessible components that make your UI look slick without breaking a sweat.

### [motion](https://motion.dev/): The Smooth Operator
Want your website to move like butter? framer-motion's got you covered. It makes animations so smooth, your users will think their screens got an upgrade.

## 3. Hosting and Deployment (Where the Magic Happens)

### Vercel: The Next.js BFF
Vercel and Next.js go together like peanut butter and jelly. It's my top pick for getting modern web apps out into the wild.

### AWS: The Swiss Army Knife of the Cloud
For those times when I need to flex my cloud muscles:
- **[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)**: Makes your content zoom across the internet.
- **[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**: The bottomless bucket for all your static goodies.
- **[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)**: When you need a computer in the cloud that can do jumping jacks.

### Plesk and WordPress: The Old School Cool
Remember [dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th)? That was my dance with Plesk and WordPress. Sometimes, you gotta appreciate the classics, you know?

## 4. Giving Back (Because It's Not All About the Code)
- I've thrown some pretty sweet IT shindigs to help folks level up their skills and make the world a bit better.
- Been the IT guy for various volunteer gigs, helping organizations step up their tech game.

So there you have it ‚Äì my tech world in a nutshell. It's a wild ride, but I wouldn't have it any other way!
